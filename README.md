Web pages with loginand logout system using Node.js,MySQL and frontend tecnologies

Here,e'll be developing a login system with Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Node.js will enable us to develop our application with JavaScript, Express is a web framework, and we'll be using MySQL to store and retrieve account details (username, password, etc.).
The Advanced package includes additional features and a download link to the source code. For more detailed information and screenshots, click here.
. Getting Started
Before we start developing our Node.js login system, we need to install software and packages that our app will depend on, and subsequently create the structure for our app.

2.1. What You Will Learn in this Tutorial
Establishing a connection to a MySQL database and selecting rows using MySQL queries.
Implementing GET and POST requests with Node.js and Express.
Designing a login form with CSS3.
Implementing validation that will ensure the captured data is valid.
Leveraging sessions, which will determine whether a user is logged in or not.

2.2. Requirements
MySQL Server >= 5.6
Node.js
Express - Install with command: npm install express --save.
Express Sessions - Install with command: npm install express-session --save.
MySQL for Node.js - Install with command: npm install mysql --save.

Follow the below instructions.

Create a new directory called nodelogin, which can be created anywhere on your environment.
Open command line as administrator, and navigate to your new directory with the following command: cd c:\nodeprojects\nodelogin
Run the command: npm init - it will prompt us to enter a package name, enter: login.
When it prompts to enter the entry point, enter login.js.
We need to install the packages listed in the requirements, so we must execute the commands listed in the requirements above.
